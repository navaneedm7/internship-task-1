This task involved performing a TCP SYN scan on the local network using Nmap  to identify active devices and open ports.
The scan helped in discovering running services such as SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, and SMB, which indicate potential network exposure.
The activity provided hands-on experience in basic network reconnaissance and demonstrated how open ports can increase the attack surface of a system.
Based on the findings, security risks were analyzed and recommendations were provided to reduce potential vulnerabilities.
